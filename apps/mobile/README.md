# GlowNow Mobile

Planned Expo (React Native) mobile application for iOS and Android.

## Status

This app is not yet implemented. The directory is a placeholder for the upcoming mobile client.

## Planned Tech Stack

- **Expo** with React Native
- **TypeScript**
- Shared components from `@repo/ui` where applicable

## Planned Scope

The mobile app will provide the client-facing booking experience:

- Browse nearby salons and their services
- View service details with pricing and duration
- Select a staff member or choose "Any Professional"
- View real-time available time slots and book appointments
- Receive push notifications for confirmations and reminders
- Manage upcoming bookings (view, cancel, reschedule)
- View booking history

The mobile app will consume the [GlowNow API](../api/README.md) for all backend operations.
